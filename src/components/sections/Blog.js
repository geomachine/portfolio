Conversations have moved beyond aesthetics into systems thinking, accessibility, and the ethics of design at scale. If you missed any of these events, most have published their talks online — well worth a weekend binge." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Building a Spacing System" },
      { type: "p", text: "The most effective approach is a base-4 or base-8 spacing scale. Every spacing value in your design should be a multiple of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64...). This creates visual consistency without requiring designers to think too hard about individual values." },
